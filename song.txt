Tory Lanez- Let's Get Married
[Verse 1]
Here we are, 20 something years old
Walkin' down on the marble stone road
I see your face, unafraid of where we go
Said, I, I
Baby, I'm not prepared to see the end of it
Love me long and I promise to end this with you, ooh-woah
And only with you-ooh, woah
Here we are, 'bout to settle down
Came a long way from single town
And we're unafraid of what the world thinks about us, yeah

[Chorus]
So let's get married young, I know that
God will guide our souls long after
Time has tickin' up, it's tickin' for you, ooh-ooh
So let's get married young, I know that
God will guide our souls long after
Time has tickin' up, it's tickin' for you, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Here you are, walkin' down through the altar
There's no words, to describe the way I feel when I'm with you, ooh-ooh
I know you feel it too, ooh
Here I am, just a man feet planted in the ground
Stayin' 10 toes down for you
Only for you, woah, woah
[Chorus]
So let's get married young, I know that
God will guide our souls long after
Time has tickin' up, it's tickin' for you, ooh-ooh
So let's get married young, I know that
God will guide our souls long after
Time has tickin' up, it's tickin' for you, ooh-ooh
